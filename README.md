### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to focus on retrieving recipe information, decoding it, and presenting it due to the limited time available for this project.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent roughly 10 hours over 4 days:
- **Day One**: I created the project, defined the design pattern (MVVM), developed the model for the recipes, and worked on the web service handler along with decoding the JSON data.
- **Day Two**: I defined my view models and views to present the received data. I also spent some time working on the user interface.
- **Day Three**: I focused on loading images, implementing caching, and making further UI improvements.
- **Day Four**: I created test cases and performed code cleanup.
  
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Yes, due to limited time, I decided to use MVVM as a design pattern since I am mostly familiar with it. However, I am trying to move to the MV design pattern used by Apple.


### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I believe there are several opportunities to enhance the user interface. Improving the layout, making navigation more intuitive, and incorporating more visually appealing elements could significantly enhance the overall user experience.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
This project was quite straightforward, and the instructions provided were clear enough to help me develop a minimum viable product (MVP). Thank you for the opportunity to interview with Fetch. I really enjoy this type of coding exercise, and I hope this demonstrates my skills effectively.
